# Who pays for deployments?

Currently, all deployments are paid for from Beth Smith's division budget.

At this time, there is no "charge back" system in place for billing each user's department budget.

The estimated cost for a given deployment is shown on the provisioning page of the user interface. Keep in mind those are "ball park" estimates for rough comparison purposes.

Deployments to 3rd party clouds are "green dollar" expenditures. Where possible use IBM Cloud (ROKS) or VMware (on-prem).

The cost of using IBM Cloud represents a "blue dollar" expenditure that is covered by Beth Smith's division budget.

The cost of using VMware (on-prem) represents a "blue dollar" expenditure that is a fixed cost that covers the data center floor space, equipment, software licenses and labor associated with the CSP Lab in Dallas.
