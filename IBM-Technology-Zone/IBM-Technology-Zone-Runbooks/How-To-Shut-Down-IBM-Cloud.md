4. To close a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account, contact Support. A support case is required for account security and documentation purposes. After your Pay-As-You-Go account has been closed, all usage is stopped across all services running in your account, and the usage that is accrued in the current billing period is sent in one final invoice at the close of the billing period. Closing your account can't be undone and your data is unrecoverable.

You must open a ticket with IBM Cloud to shut down an account owned by an employee who no longer works at IBM or is on a leave of absence.
