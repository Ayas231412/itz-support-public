## How to Schedule a Workshop

Group reservations can be scheduled on IBM Technology Zone using the "schedule a workshop" feature which takes you to the Workshop Manager. 

**Berfore getting started:** 

Workshops support VMWare, IBM Cloud, SaaS, and Hosted environment requests at this time.

What is a "Hosted" environment? 

A hosted environment is an "Always-on" environment, meaning the cluster is running 24/7 that you can request access too. When requesting to schedule a workshop 
with a hosted environment, keep in mind that each student will be accessing the same cluster. Whereas on Skytap, each student gets assigned their own environment.
