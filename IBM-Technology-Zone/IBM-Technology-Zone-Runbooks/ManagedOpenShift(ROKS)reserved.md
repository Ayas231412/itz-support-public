## ManagedOpenShift (ROKS) Environments

Once you submit an environment request your screen will now tell you if your reservation has been created, example screenshot below. You will receive an email with more information on how to access your environment when the environment is ready. 

Note: If you chose the "Schedule for later" option, you will receive the email close to your scheduled date, not at the time of hitting submit.

NOTE: documentation for an environment can be found in Collections. Click "related collection" this contains the resource information. 

Reservation emails include important details like username/passwords, guides, surveys, how to docs etc. Please read carefully.

The reservation email looks like below, additional email is sent once the Environment is ready with access detail.

From ["My reservation page"](https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations) you can find the status of the environment. Once your environment is ready for use the status is updated to "Ready".
