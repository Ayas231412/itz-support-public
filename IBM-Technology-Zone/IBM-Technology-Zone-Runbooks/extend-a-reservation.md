Your reservation will automatically be extended till the new date and time selected. One week increments ONLY


NOTE: if "extend" is greyed out, you do not have an opportunity number attached to your reservation. Edit your reservation to include a valid opportunity number. If you get any errors request support on slack channel #dte-techzone-support, Include the Opportunity number and reservation information (Environment id, dekstop url, cluster id,  cluster name etc )

Are you going on vacation and worried about loosing your reservation? You can transfer it to a colleague to manage while away, see details [here](https://github.ibm.com/dte-support/public/blob/master/IBM%20Technololgy%20Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/transfer_environment.md)

Attention: It is a user's responsibility to ensure they extend reservations before the listed end date and time. 
All exception request should come in at least 72 hours before the scheduled end date and time. 
Environments are auto removed once reservations are expired and are currently not recoverable.
