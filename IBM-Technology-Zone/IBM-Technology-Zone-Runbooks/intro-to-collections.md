# Introduction to Collections

What is a collection?

* A collection is a group of related resources that can include additional or multiple nested collections.

What does a collection look like on IBM Technology Zone? 

* Here is an example of a simple collection: [Custom ROKS & VMWare requests](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vm-ware-requests)

See on this collection that there are resources to help the end user get started with one of the following environments, like the setup guide for the VMWare Cloud adoption lab. 

**NOTE:** Collections can be customized to look more complex than this one. For example, collections with journeys.
Read the [Introduction to Journeys](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/intro-collection-journey.md) runbook to see how owners/authors can drive a specific learning journey with their collections by ordering resources and environments into tabs that we call journeys.

* A collection can encompass resources, environments, and journeys. It can be as complex or as simple as the owner/author deems fit to make the collection based on the experience they intend to drive to the consumer of their content. 

* A collections is not limited to pointing to other additional collections from one collection. Collections can be nested within a collection and managed similar to a resource on a collection. 

Here is an example of multiple nested collections on this main collection: [Cloud Pak for Business Automation Activiation Kit](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-for-automation-activation-kit#tab-2)

**NOTE:** The box icon represents that this resource is of type collection. Hover over the box to see the type for yourself.
