# Find content accessible today for Business Partners

IBM Technology Zone is accessible to IBMers and Business Partners that validate through Partner World. 

See Partner access runbook for additional details on getting Partner World account properly setup. 

**Option 1:** How to navigate Business Partner content and environments from the search page.

From search, as an IBMer a "Visibility" filter will be accessible to use and filter on Business Partner visible content.

NOTE: Business Partners will not have this filter option, as they will only see content visible to them.

Additionally see another level of clarity on the table or grid views when looking through results.

- Grid view

- Table view

**Option 2:** How to navigate collection level business partner visibility and the underlying resources.

From a collection page, see the visibility field in the top banner under the title of the collection. Business Partner visibility at the collection level means that this collection would have shown in the previous search results above.

Navigating the resources on a collection to see visibility level can be identified similar to the grid view on the search page. See the visibility field on each resource to identify what a partner would see when on this collection.

Additionally, for collections that have journey tabs setup, select the journey (tab) and reference the visibility column to identify what a partner would see when on this journey within this collection.
