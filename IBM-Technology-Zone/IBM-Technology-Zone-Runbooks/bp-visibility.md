# Find content accessible today for Business Partners

IBM Technology Zone is accessible to IBMers and Business Partners that validate through Partner World. 

See Partner access runbook for additional details on getting Partner World account properly setup. 

**Option 1:** How to navigate Business Partner content and environments from the search page.

From search, as an IBMer a "Visibility" filter will be accessible to use and filter on Business Partner visible content.

NOTE: Business Partners will not have this filter option, as they will only see content visible to them.

Example: Notice in both persona example screenshots below that each persona (IBMr and Business Partner) will see different Journeys (tabs) and different resources and environments on each collection. Use this feature to see what exactly a Business Partner would see on each collection and easily navigate back from IBMer and Parnter to compare.

If you have questions as to why the content author made a specific collection, resource, environment, or journey (tab) only available to an IBMer. Feel free to contact the content owner to find out if the specific collection, resource, environment, or journey (tab) can be made available to business partners as well.
