# Free 3rd Party Cloud Environments for Education Purposes

IBM Technology Zone has 3rd party cloud environments available today but only in support of client facing opportunities. The current reservation form will validate an active IBM Sales Cloud opportunity code or the Relationship Gainsite ID when entered on the reservation form. If the ID or Opportunity code is not validate/active then a usesr will not be able to proceed with the reservation request.
