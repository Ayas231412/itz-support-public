**** **IMPACT TO CONTENT** ****

IBM Technology Zone will be auditing all collections to ensure that content is updated before this release. An example of content that needs to be updated based on description field text owned by content authors can be found in the screenshot below. Any mentions of how to navigate the collection page that reference the old UI/UX design must be removed or updated to reflect the new being released on March 22nd, 2023. Additionally, content owners will need to plan to update their resources as needed that may have screenshots of the old UI on or after March 22nd, 2023.
