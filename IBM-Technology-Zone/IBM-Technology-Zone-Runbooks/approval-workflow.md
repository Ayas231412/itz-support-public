- How long will a request take to be reviewed? 

The IBM Technology Zone team will review requests within 3 to 5 business days. As we onboard additional teams, we will work through enhancements to capture their policies and review process to ensure users have more information regarding their request. 

- What emails will I revieve through out the request process? 

Users will receive an email confirming that their request was submitted which will be a pending approval status email. Along with an email once a request has been approved or denied. For requests that have been denied, a reason is required for the approving group to provide to the user/requestor and additional comments will be required that will be shared in the email.

- Where can I find  my requests that are pending approval? 

Users/Requestors can find requests that are pending approval right from their reservations widget from their dashboard

## How to setup an environment to be requested through the approval workflow

If you have an environment that you would like to add an approval workflow for, please contact brooke.jones@ibm.com to get started as we just released this new experience in the 23.1 release and are working through slowly onboarding users and content teams to gather feedback on experience for further improvements. 

Working with our team, we will work with you to understand the environment constraints for needing the approval workflow, go through a process to onboard your approving group, and lastly review duration policies for your environment.

## Approvals Page

The "Approvals" page is an approving group permissions page that allows approvers to review and manage requests. 

Follow process above for how to steup an environment to be setup with necessary permissions to see the approvals page. 

Initially the page will display a list of summaries for each request.
