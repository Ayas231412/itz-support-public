# Industry Environment Request Process and Expectations

The following document is a step-by-step of how to submit an Industry Environment Request and the manual processing performed in order to fulfill the request.

**Note on this Aha form:** This request form is only temporary.  Eventually the goal is to automate the on- and off-boarding of users.  As that happens, industry environments will be removed from the form.

1. Navigate to the **Industry Environment Requests form**: https://sbaas.ideas.aha.io/ideas/new

2. Login with your IBMid credentials

NOTE: Business Partners and IBMrs with a IBMid can sign into this form

We highly encourage you to submit your request 1 week prior to the planned client engagement to ensure content can be prepared in support of your client meeting. Content owners are available to assist in content customization in support of large client opportunities.

6. While waiting, here is what is taking place behind the scenes:

- The IBM Technology Zone team receives the request and routes it to the owning IBM team. This routing piece could take 1-2 business days. The owning team will depend based upon the Industry Environment you selected in the Aha form that you are requesting access to. 
- Once the IBM team is aware of your request, there is an additional time frame needed to setup the environment and to provide you access. This piece could take 2-3 business days. You will be emailed by the owning team once your environment has been properly setup. This email will include credentials and other information to help with onboarding. 

7. Access your Industry Environment! 

8. Requested end date coming due process: Once the Industry Environment requested end date is coming due to expire, the IBM Technology Zone team will contact the owning Industry environment IBM team about the expired request. The Industry environment owning team will then off-board the user, if necessary. 

NOTE: If you need more time, please be sure to contact the owning IBM team about how long you would like to extend the requested end date to so that you do not lose your environment. IBM owning team would have to approve the extension, as this is not a garantee. Providing a valid oppotunity code will help justify the need of the extension.
