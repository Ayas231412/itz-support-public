# Reservation Durations and Extension Policy 

This Documentation contains information for how Long you can reserve an Environment For? 

Please review the following enhancement added to IBM Technology Zone's reservation forms to improve the visibility for our users to see exactly how long they can reserve an environment for, and to understand the current policies in place today.

## Current Policies as of March 8th

![reservation duration policies](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/Screen%20Shot%202023-03-07%20at%2011.25.27%20AM.png)

## Find Duration Policies on TechZone Reservations Form

Now find two places on the reservation form that display the amount of time in which a user can reserve an environment (see screenshot below). 

![reservation durations](Images/reservation_durations.png)

Watch how the reservation durations will change as you fill out the form. Providing more information, for example, selecting a "Customer Demo", "Proof of Concept", or "Proof of Technology" purpose and providing a valid IBM Sales Cloud or Gainsite relationship ID will provide you more time on the intial reservation form, dependent on the infrastructure.

## Costs Updated

Estimated costs are now displayed, which are estimated based upon the build materials and length of your reservation. At the moment, they only appear in the "create a reservation request" section.

### Definitions

**Default duration:** Without selecting a purpose or geo on the initial reservation form, this will be the default time frames that you can reserve this environment to start. 

**Maximum duration:** As you fill out the form, the maximum duration will be the maximum duration you can choose to reserve the environment. (Note: users can leverage the extend option if they provide a valid opportunity code after making the inital reservation based on [reservation duration policies](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/reservation-duration-policy.md))

**Delay by:** There are some environments that you can reserve that need to be scheduled before the environment will start provisioning. For example: A delay by date of 3 days, means that you will not be able to select a start date until three days from today's date. 

**Extension duration:** This environment will allow you to extend for the stated duration after reserving the environment. For example: An extension duration of 7 days means that you will be able to extend this reservation every week for another 7 days.

**Extension limit:** This environment has a limited number of extensions. For example: Having an extension limit of 3 means that you can extend your reservation every week for another 7 days but there is a limit to extending 3 times only. 

## Workshops

The maximum duration for environments leveraging the Workshop Manager is **5** days.

The maximum number of environments that can be scheduled using Workshop Manager is **80** environments and has to be submitted **72 hours** before the intended start date. We suggest submitting your request earlier than 72 hours for environments request greater than **40**.

An exception request is required for any Workshop that exceeds the stated maximums.
