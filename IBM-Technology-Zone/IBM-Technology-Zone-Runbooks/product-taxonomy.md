# Product taxonomy on IBM Technology Zone

How it works today and who to contact based on the issue you are facing with IBM Technology Zone's taxonomy. 

## Basics of IBM Unified Taxonomy (UT)

Learn more about [unitified taxonomy terminology](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/unified-taxonomy/ut-terminology)

To find your official product, brand, and business unit, please visit the official [IBM Federated Catalog (FedCat)](https://uatfedcat001.w3-969.ibm.com:9201/).

![Fedcat products](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/Fedcat%20products.png)

Use the 'Search term:' field to search for your product. 

Lets look up Cloud Pak for Data as an example in the catalog to find the Brand and Business Unit for this product:

Reference the following taxonomy breakout:

* Product: UT level 30 code

* Brand: UT level 15 code

* Business unit: UT level 10 code

## Effective Unified Taxonomy (UT) overall mapping as of today

See all taxonomy levels available today from Federate Catalog [here](https://prodfedcat001.w3-969.ibm.com:9201/ut_hierarchy.html).

Ensure both 'Exclude' options are both selected, as these will remove finance records that are not relevent.

Additionally review the Level 10 and Level 15 options as needed to find the offering you are looking for and the true taxonomy behind the scenes.

## How to catalog the correct taxonomy for your collection on IBM Technology Zone

Based on the example above, for the IBM Products field, start typing in the product name that this collection is related to. A drop-down list will display once you are finished typing with results to choose from. Select the best product match from the list. 

![Product drop down list](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/product%20drop%20down%20list.png)

After selecting Cloud Pak for Data in the drop-down list the Business Unit and Brand will automatically populate. Displaying the end result as shown below.
