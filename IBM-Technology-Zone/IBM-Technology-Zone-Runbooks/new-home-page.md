* Featured assets tab - This content is flagged by the Digital Technical Engagement team and is revolved around key initiatives and new infrastructure options being released on IBM Technology Zone month to month. Additionally we call out different environment portals to help close the gap for tech sellers to find other infrastructure options that IBM Technology Zone does not have existing today.

* Activation kits tab - An Activation Kit organizes multiple assets into tabs (called journeys) similar to other collection pages, but in particular orders them for a wholistic solution approach. Activation kits help you navigate your end to end asset journey and include assets that are needed through out each phase of the sales cycle. 

* Platinum tab - Platinum content is the highest quality content available on IBM Technology Zone today! This content has been significantly reviewed before being promoted for IBMer and BP use, with even sign offs and approval from product offering teams behind each solution. See all Platinum content on IBM Technology Zone from this tab.
