# Github Repository as a Resource Best Practices

When using Public Github Repositories as resources, be aware of which users can access the Repositories.

Business Partner and IBM Accessible - https://github.com/

IBMer Only - https://github.ibm.com/

Note: If the Repositories are Private, they require permissions to be set for users to have access. This is not advisable to be used for a resource on an ITZ Collection.

When using a Git Repo as an additional Resource for your Collection, be sure to use the correct Repo. If this resource is available to BPs and IBMers, use https://github.com/. If this resource is only available to IBMers, you can also use https://github.ibm.com/.
