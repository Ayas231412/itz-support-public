# Introduction to journeys

What is a journey? 

* A sequenced navigation implemented via tabs to better guide consumers through the collection.

What does a journey look like on a collection?

* Reference [Cloud Pak for Data collection](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-4-data) as an example.

* Each tab is a journey specified and created by the content owner to help drive a particular engagement or activity.
* Each journey will have its own set of resources that align based on the content owners intent of the journey
