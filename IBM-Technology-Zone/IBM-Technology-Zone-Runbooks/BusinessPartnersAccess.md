# Business Partners (BPs) Authenticated on IBM Partner Plus (PP) Have Access to IBM Technology Zone Using Their IBM Ids.

In some cases BPs do not have their IBM Ids associated with their companies partner profile, which affects their access to IBM Technology Zone and results in Error 403.

Steps to resolve:

Have the BP reach out to their company authorized profile administrators [APA] to have their IBM id attached to your company partner account.
If they do not know their APA, they can go to PP and use the chatbot or contact PP support Desk https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/resources/support
Once their account is attached, they will be able to access IBM Technology Zone.
