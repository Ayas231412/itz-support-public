Your reservation will automatically be extended till the new date and time selected. Please note, you have unlimited 1 week extensions for the validity of your opportunity number. You are able to extend a reservation within 120 hours (5 days) of your current end date.

Self - education or test can now be extended for an additional five days only.

If you need more time you can [change your reservation purpose](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/extend-self-education-into-sales-demo.md) to enable additional self- extension, you will be able to update the purpose, add your opportunity number and then self-extend.

NOTE: if "extend" is greyed out, you do not have an opportunity number attached to your reservation. [Edit your reservation to include a valid opportunity number.](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/extend-self-education-into-sales-demo.md) If you get any errors contact support, Include the Opportunity number and reservation information (Environment id, dekstop url, cluster id,  cluster name etc )

Are you going on vacation and worried about losing your reservation? You can transfer it to a colleague to manage while away, see details [here](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/transfer_environment.md)

Attention: It is a user's responsibility to ensure they extend reservations before the listed end date and time. 
Environments are auto removed once reservations are expired and are currently not recoverable. All exception request should come in at least 72 hours before the scheduled end date and time.
