# How to Lock and Unlock an Environment on a Collection

Content authors have the ability to lock and unlock an environment on a collection.

Collaborators will not be able to lock and unlock an environment on a collection, they will have to reach out to content owner to unlock before making changes.

## How to Lock an Environment:

1. If the environment is published on the collection (status is enabled), to lock the environment: select the status to 'Enabled and Locked'.

2. If you would like to lock an environment that is not currently published as a collection owner (status is disabled): select the status 'Disabled and Locked'.

3. Locking the environment will block collaborators from making updates to the environment until the status is set to a non locked status.

## How to Unlock an Environment:
1. If the environment is published on the collection (status Enabled and Locked), and you want to unlock the environment: set the status to 'Enabled'.

2. If the environment is not published on the collection and the owner wants to unlock the environment (status Disabled and Locked): update the status to 'Disabled'.

3. Only content authors will be able to unlock any environment that is currently locked.
