# How to create a resource on a collection

In this runbook we will walk through field by field how to add a resource to your collection. 

1. Make sure you are on the edit collection form. 

Reference the [How to edit your collectiom runbook](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/edit-a-collection.md) for additional help on this step. 

2. Scroll down to the Resource section and select **Add a resource**.

3. **Resource title:** Provide an intuitive name for this resource.

4. **Resource type field:** Select the type of resource that you are adding to this collection. Reference the [Resource type definitions runbook](https://github.ibm.com/itz-support/private/blob/master/AssetRepo/AssetRepo-Runbooks/resource-types.md) for more information on what types of resources you can share on your collection.

5. **Short business value statement:** Similar to the short business value statement for the collection, provide a compelling one sentence description outlineing the value that this resource will provide the end user after leveraging it.

6. **Resource URL field:** Provide the URL to the resource that you would like to share. The resource can live in Seismic, Box, Github, or any content management platform that the resource is located on. 

**BOX Warning:** Please read through the [Resource Box link best practices runbook](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/box-best-practices.md) to ensure that your Box url is accessible to the the intended visibility user level (Business Partners or IBMr).

**GitHub Warning:** Please read through the [Github Runbook Best Practices Runbook](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/github-runbook-best-practices.md) to ensure that your Github Rnbook is accessible.

**Seismic Warning:** (best practices coming soon)

7. **Visibility field:** Similar to the collection visibility level, you can decide to the resource level what a user can view depending if they are signed in as a Business Partner or an IBMr. 

**NOTE:** You can check a collections visibility levels to be Business Partner and IBMr accessible and provide resources that are only IBMr or only Business Partner accessible as long as you indicate them as such with the visibility level fields for that collection and specific resource.

8. **Status field:** Choose Enabled for this to show as a published resource on this collection or Disabled to remove from view on the collection.

* Feel free to create additional resources by following the same instructions followed above. 

10. Lastly, proceed down to the bottom of your edit collection form to **save** the entire collection with the newly added resource(s).

11. **You have now added your first resource(s)!!**

Select the view tab at the top right hand corner of the edit collection form. If your new collection is not displaying yet, refresh your page a few times or wait a few minutes for your changes to update through the cached layer.
