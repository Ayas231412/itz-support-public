# Share an Environment with a Client

You will need to provision the environment yourself, but it can be shared to clients

## Please note: The use of Customer Data is not allowed on IBM Technology Zone.

## Skytap
For Skytap environments you can share the access information for the client to use (Desktop URL and password or application links).  
In this method, there is no limit to invited users.

Just send the client the Desktop URL and password ddirectly to provide them access. You can find that information below.

Example of Desktop URL for VM access  
![email](/Skytap/Skytap-Runbooks/Images/email.png)  

Example of Application links for access just to an application  
![published-service](Images/Defined-port-email.png)  

## ROKS or Other
ROKS environments can be shared with any users with an IBM ID, https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/share_environment.md.
