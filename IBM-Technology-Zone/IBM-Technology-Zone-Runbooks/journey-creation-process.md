# How to create a journey

Reference the [Introduction to journeys runbook](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/intro-collection-journey.md) to learn more about what a journey is and how to find them on a collection. 


## Before you get started

* You must first have a collection already created. Reference [How to create a collection runbook](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/create-collection.md).
* If you already have a collection, Reference the [How to edit a collection runbook](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/edit-a-collection.md) in order to add a journey. 

**IMPORTANT NOTICE: You must have resources or environments already created before adding a journey**

Reference [How to create a resource](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/add-a-resource.md) and [How to create an environment](WIP) runbooks to get started with this process. 


## Create a Journey

1. Once on the edit collection page scroll down to the journeys section.

![Add a journey section](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/edit%20collection%20add%20journey%20section.png)

2. Select "Add a journey" button to create your first journey.

![Add a journey form](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/add%20a%20journey%20form.png)

3. Fill in the minimum required journey fields:

* **Journey title** - This will be the label you see on the tab of your collection. 

Reference the [Cloud Pak for Data collection](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/cloud-pak-4-data) example with screenshot provided above to see the journeys created for that collection. 

* **Description** - Provide an overview of what value or end result this journey will provide to the consumer of this content.

* **Visibility** - Decide what users can see this journey. Is it just IBMr applicable? Is it specific to Business Partners? Select the necessary users that you want to be able to see this journey when visiting your collection. 

* **Status** - Make sure that enabled is set if you want this to display on your published collection. Status of disabled will remove from the public view. 

4. Now, lets associate which resources and environments that you would like to display in this collection.

* See in the bottom right hand corner of the journey edit form the resources and environments that you have created on this collection. Here is an example of what this section will look like if you have resources and environments already created. If you do not see a list of resources and collections, please reference the before you get started section above to get additional runbook support in how to add an environment or a resource on your collection. 

![Resources and environments section](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/resources%20and%20environments%20to%20choose%20from%20for%20journey%20creation.png)

* Drag and drop the resources and environments that you want on the journey tab to the right hand Journey section. 

See and end result example below of after dragging and dropping the resources and environments to the Journey section that you would like to see dispaly under this journey tab. 

![Drag and drop journey creation](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/drag%20and%20drop%20journey%20creation.png)

**Important Note:** Resources and Environments that are **NOT** associated to a Journey will be universal resources that can be found under the journeys resources. See example of where the orphaned resources and environments will display.

5. Select 'Save' to capture this newly created journey. 

Wait for the Journey saved notification to display before continueing to next step.

6. Navigate to the 'Preview' button at the bottom of the edit collection form to see how your new journey will display.

![Preview option](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/preview%20option.png)

7. Then proceed down to the bottom of your edit collection form to save the entire collection with this newly added journey.

![Save the collection](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/save%20the%20collection.png)

* Wait for the Collection saved notification to display before continueing. 

![Save collection notification](https://github.com/IBM/dte-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Images/save%20collection%20notification.png)

8. **You have now created your first Journey!!**

Select the view tab at the top right hand corner of the edit collection form. If your new collection is not displaying yet, refresh your page a few times or wait a few minutes for your changes to update through the cached layer.
