# Reservation Form Updates
In this release, the there are many improvements to the reservations form based on stakeholder input and NPS survey feedback. Read below to see what changed when making a reservation for an environment on IBM Technology Zone.
## 1. Reservation Cost Estimates
Filling out the reservation start and end date will now generate a cost estimate for ROKS environment reservations on TechZone.
**NOTE: Reservations are still paid for by IBM Technology Zone team and are FREE OF COST to our users.**
How does it work?
- This cost breakdown is only available for IBMer users at this time
- Based on the date and time selected to start and end on the reservation form, we calculate an estimated cost
- The hourly rates for each ROKS environment are based on historical reservation costs that we have estimated an hourly rate for

## 2. No Customer Data Agreement on Every Reservation
Every users must adhere and agree on every environment reservation form that the environment being reserved will not be used with customer data.
- IBM Technology Zone environments are not to be used with customer data.
- This check box captures your agreement that customer data will not be used within environments IBM Technology Zone provides.
- If customer data is found on an IBM Technology Zone environment, the reservation owner will be held responsible.
**NOTE: The reservation owner should take any necessary measures to ensure that any user that the environment is shared with understands that this environment is not to be used with customer data.**

## 3. Improved Visibility of Reservation Policies
You asked, we listened. The reservation duration policies once placed on the right hand menu of the reservation form were reported from our users difficult to understand.
- Find the reservation duration policies now written under the end date picker.
- Reservation duration policies are dependent on the infrastructure being reserved and the purpose selected.
- See in this example that the environment can be reserved for up to two weeks total. Three days on the initial reservation form, but after the reservation owner can extend the environment reservation duration to get the total two weeks.

## 4. Condensed Collection and Environment Information
To reduce the amount of information that initially displays on a reservation form, we have taken the collection information and environment information and made them expandable components. If you want to easily navigate back to the collection to get more information on the content or environment itself, exapnd each section for more information on what you are reserving.
- The expandable collection and environment information can be found in the right hand menu on every reservation form.
- The hyperlinked collection name and environment name will both navigate the user back to the collection landing page.
- The description of the collection descriptions that display underneath the hyperlinked names are the short descriptions for the collection and environment directly provided by the content owner.
