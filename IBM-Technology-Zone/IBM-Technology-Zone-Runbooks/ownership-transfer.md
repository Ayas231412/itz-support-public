Ownership Transfer

When the existing owner of a collection has an invalid IBM email (caused by separation from IBM typically), an automated job will fire an email off to all other contributors in that collection. Whomever claims the collection first will become the new owner of the collection.

The email contributors look will look similar to below:

If you are a contributor, you will be able to click the Update Ownership link on the bottom. Next click the accept ownership button to accept ownership of the collection.
