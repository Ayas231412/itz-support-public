# How to contribute Platinum content

How can I promote my content as Platinum content on IBM Technology Zone myself? 

## Platinum Content Contributor Guidelines

Platinum content is how we distinguish the top quality content on IBM Technology Zone. With top quality content comes extensive reviews and conditions that must be met before marking content as Platinum. 

In order for Platinum content to be of the highest quality, you must agree to:

1. Complete each of the form fields as directed and with the proper detail in order to ensure intuitive, robust, and consistent guidance for the consumer.
2.  Provide a troubleshooting guide, runbook and/or step-by-step script as part of your collection. 
3.  Make content accessible to Business Partners by ensuring content is in a publicly accessible repository, does not contain any IBM Confidential information or pre-release GA software.
4.  Assign an SME to complete a thorough editorial review of all content in the collection per provided guidelines.
5.  Keep your collection current by:
* Changing anything that is no longer factually accurate since initial publication
Updating when a new product version has been released that contains new features or offerings that impacts the currency of the content
Removing content if it is no longer viable.
Not share Sensitive Client Data, Personal Information, Sensitive or Confidential Data pursuant to IBM GDPR and IBM BCG Guidelines.
* Support your content either via personal email or by providing a Slack community channel and adhere to providing a response within 24 hours of receipt of the inquiry.
* If you are part of Bob Kalkaâ€™s TechDemo squad, you must also agree to:
* Provide a step-by-step demo script in the collection
* Allocate a squad member(s) to complete the editorial review of all content in the collection
* Gain sign off from OM squad member on the demo scenario meaning content is worthy of platinum status

Not adhering to the above terms and conditions will mean content does not suffice Platinum standards.
