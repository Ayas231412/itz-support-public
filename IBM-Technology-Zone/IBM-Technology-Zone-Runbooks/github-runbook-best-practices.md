# ITZ Github Runbook Best Practices

DTE Support has 2 Github Repos available for Runbooks.

Business Partner and IBM Accessible - https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public

IBMer Only - https://github.ibm.com/itz-support/public

When using a Runbook as an additional Resource for your Collection, be sure to use the correct Repo. If your Collection is available to BPs and IBMers, use https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public. If your Collection is only available to IBMers, use https://github.ibm.com/itz-support/public.

Linking directly to a specific Runbook can be done like this https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/transfer_environment.md. Clicking that link takes the user directly to the Runbook with instructions on how to resolve their issue.

Linking to one of the support areas like this https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/tree/main/IBM-Technology-Zone, provides the user an index of different Runbooks they can sort through to find their issue.

For help creating a new Runbook, or uploading a Runbook to one of these Repos, contact DTE Support.
