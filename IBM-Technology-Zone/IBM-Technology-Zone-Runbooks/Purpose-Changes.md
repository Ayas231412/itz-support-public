# Purpose Changes

At this time, we do **not** allow the changing of reservation purposes. 

This was announced with the added ability to have client data on our TechZone 23.2 Launch.

For IBMers, this announcement can be seen [here](https://ibm-cloud.slack.com/archives/C0124J683GW/p1689861600822839)

How this is tied in with the addition of client data enablement can also be viewed in our runbook [here](https://github.com/IBM/itz-support-public/blob/main/IBM-Technology-Zone/IBM-Technology-Zone-Runbooks/Customer-data%20on%20TechZone.md)
