3. Please be patient as we pull metrics live for this specific collection from the data set. 
4. In the top left of the collection metrics modal, see the option to select a start and end date that you would like to pull metrics on for this specific collection.

**DISCLAIMER: IBM Technology Zone team started sending the collection ID associated with every reservation as of August 1st. We have done our best to go through historical reservation data and associate a related collection, but not all data has been matched one to one. Please contact brooke.jones@ibm.com with questions and concerns.**

6. Select how you want to view the metrics with the table or chart option.
