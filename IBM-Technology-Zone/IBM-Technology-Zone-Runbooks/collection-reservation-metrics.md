5. Then select a start and end date that you would like to pull metrics on for this specific collection. After selecting the duration, the data will populate the charts. NOTE: Please be patient as we pull metrics live for this specific collection from the data set. 

**DISCLAIMER: IBM Technology Zone team started sending the collection ID associated with every reservation as of August 1st. We have done our best to go through historical reservation data and associate a related collection, but not all data has been matched one to one. Please contact brooke.jones@ibm.com with questions and concerns.**

7. View the following  metrics and learn the terminology: 
    * Unique users - Unique visitors refers to the number of distinct individuals visting your collection during the selected time frame selected. 
    * Persona - type of user visiting your collection. 
          - User IBMr
          - User Business Partner
          - User persona not captured could be IBMrs that have left the company that are no longer available in Blue pages.
    * Region - location of the user visiting your collection. 
    * Reservation by region - datacenter region where the environment was deployed.

8. Take the data with you and make your own charts with the download option in the bottom right of the collection metrics modal. This option is accessible for all reservation metrics tied to your collection and individual reservation reports.
