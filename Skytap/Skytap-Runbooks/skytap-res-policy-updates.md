# Reservation Duration Policy Updates as of October 24th

This runbook will explain in detail the policy updates that are coming into effect October 24th with examples of active reservations that will be impacted and how. 

## Body

**What's Changed**

**Skytap reservations** with a purpose of Customer Demo, POC, or POT extension limits are being reduced each week in order to align all Skytap reservations with an end date of December 31st. _REMINDER: Skytap migration is to be completed by end of year._ 

**Why This Change**

This change is in effect as of October 24th due to reported high monthly costs for Skytap, AWS, and Azure insfrastructure's in September, and aligns with the [go-to-market efficiences](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-technology-sales-hub/leadership-blogs/205750e0-19bd-11ed-b604-1d206bf34037)

**Impact to active reservations**

Any active Skytap reservation made on or before October 24th will be impacted by this new duration policy change.

**Skytap reservations** with a purpose of **Customer Demo, POC, or POT** have 12 extensions of 1 week increments allowed before October 24th. After October 24th, each week the number of extensions allowed will be reduced each week to align with December 31st reservation end date. The following are the expected extension limit reductions to take place each week till the end of the year for Skytap Customer Demo, POC, or POT reservations:

  - October 24th: Extension limit will be reduced to 7 extensions of 1 week increments.
  - October 31st: Extension limit will be reduced to 6 extensions of 1 week increments.
  - November 7th: Extension limit will be reduced to 5 extensions of 1 week increments.
  - November 14th: Extension limit will be reduced to 4 extensions of 1 week increments.
  - November 21st: Extension limit will be reduced to 3 extensions of 1 week increments.
  - November 28th: Extension limit will be reduced to 2 extensions of 1 week increments.
  - December 5th: Extension limit will be reduced to 1 extensions of 1 week.
  - December 12th: No extensions allowed on Skytap reservations as of this date.

Note: Max durations allowed on initial reservation when filling out the reservation form will remain the same: 2 weeks 

**Examples of active Skytap reservations impacted:**

Active Skytap reservation with a purpose of Customer Demo made **before October 24th**. The reservation currently has 10 extensions left. 
- As of October 24th, the current Skytap reservation extension limit will be reduced to 7 extensions allowed on the reservation. This change is the same for reservations with a purpose of POC or POT as well. 

Active Skytap reservation with a purpose of POT made **after October 24th**. New reservations will have the new policies applied. 
- As of October 24th and through to October 31st, new reservations made through out this duration will take on the new policy and have 7 extensions of 1 week increments. 
- As of October 31st and through to November 7th, new reservations made through out this duration will take on the new policy and have 6 extension of 1 week increments. 
- and so forth for new reservations made based on the dates and policies listed above. 

_This change is in place to align all Skytap reservations with an end date before December 31st as Skytap is to be shutdown by end of year._

**Support for users active reservations made before October 24th as we transition to new policies**
