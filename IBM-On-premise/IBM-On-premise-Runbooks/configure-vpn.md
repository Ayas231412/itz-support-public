# Configure your VPN connection

:warning: *If you are an IBMer* either at an IBM location or connection to IBM from home or remote office through Cisco AnyConnect, you don't need to use this guide. You already have access to the systems from the IBM intranet.


## Download Cisco AnyConnect

:warning: If you already have cisco 4.4 or greater installed on your system, you should skip to [Connecting the VPN](#Coonecting the VPN).


Open your browser and enter [https://asa003b.centers.ihost.com](https://asa003b.centers.ihost.com) in the address field. If for some reason the name is not resolving, you can use the IP address (32.97.185.16). The URL will automatically expand to the one shown in the following screenshot:

You will be presented with the welcome screen shown above. If you do not see it, if the page does not load, there are some things to check:
1. Do you have a firewall installed on your system that may be blocking the connection?
2. Is your browser configured with a proxy that restricts access to certain sites?
3. Are you on a corporate network with restricted internet access?
You may need to engage your local IT helpdesk to help resolve the connectivity issues.

Assuming the page loads properly, in the middle of the screen you will see the Login section. The Group is a drop-down menu, but unless told otherwise by the project manager, you should choose the default *AnyConnect*.

This is the easiest and most common method for gaining access to the Garage, and is the one you will use unless the project manager has instructed otherwise. Access to the portal requires a browser with Java enabled. Windows, Mac, and Linux are supported, but see Appendix A for full details on system requirements.

Note: Every OS and browser has their own look, security policy, and notification system. What follows is an example connection using Windows 7 and Firefox. You may see more “pop-ups” or perhaps none at all, but it is important to follow the messages that do appear, so that the installation process is not blocked or disabled.
