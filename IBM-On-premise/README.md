# IBM On-premise

## Known limitations
- Extending a reservation is not possible:
This will be addressed soon and is coming in a future release.
- Sereval resources within a same network: 
If you need more than 1 resource that have to communicate with each other, please keep booking resources through our [old portal](http://ibm.biz/cecc-portal).
- Request HMC access


## Self-service actions currently not available
- Add a second disk after the creation:
A workaround is to cancel your current reservation and add a second disk during the booking process.
- Add more VPN IDs
Please open a ticket to have more IDs
- Add shared storage
Please open a ticket for that action.
