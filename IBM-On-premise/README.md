# IBM On-premise

## Known limitations
- Extending a reservation is not possible: This will be addressed soon and is coming in a future release.
- Sereval resources within a same network: If you need more than 1 resource that have to communicate with each other, please keep booking resources through our [old portal](http://ibm.biz/cecc-portal).
- Request HMC access: If you really need HMC access, please book through our [old portal](http://ibm.biz/cecc-portal).


## Self-service runtime actions currently not available
- Add a second disk after the creation: A workaround is to cancel your current reservation and add a second disk during the booking process.
- Add more VPN IDs: please open a ticket
